How to run tests

TODO:
  - write readme file
  - add authentication
  - add tls and disallow http, add self-signed cert
  - install on my server
  - add existing transactions to server
    - consider automated way to download them?
    - perhaps download the JSON directly from google scripts?
    - perhaps download them all from plaid directly?
    - make sure they match plaid id
  - add logging for downloading transactions, including how long it takes and metrics around how many records were changed
  - run transaction downloader on a schedule
